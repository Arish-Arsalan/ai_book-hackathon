Sensing Systems
Overview

Sensing systems provide information for perception, localization, and interaction.

Key Sensor Modalities

Vision: cameras, depth sensors, LIDAR

Tactile: touch, pressure, force

Proprioceptive: joint angles, IMUs

Audio: microphones for sound localization

Sensor Integration

Sensor fusion techniques: Kalman filters, particle filters, deep learning

Benefits: robust perception, reduced uncertainty

Summary

Sensing systems enable robots to perceive their environment accurately and interact intelligently.
