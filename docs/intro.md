# Introduction to Physical AI

## Overview
Physical Artificial Intelligence (Physical AI) refers to intelligent systems that extend beyond digital reasoning and exist within physical bodies capable of sensing, interacting with, and acting upon the real world. Unlike conventional software-based AI, Physical AI integrates embodiment, mechanical design, perception, actuation, and decision-making in dynamic environments.

This chapter introduces the core concepts, motivations, and challenges of Physical AI.

## What Is Physical AI?
Physical AI is the intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics, machine learning, mechatronics, control theory, and human–robot interaction. These systems possess:

- **A physical embodiment** (robot body, drone, vehicle, wearable device)
- **Perception systems** (cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, force sensors)
- **Actuators** (motors, pneumatic systems, hydraulics)
- **Decision-making models** (ML models, RL controllers, planners)
- **Closed-loop control** (real-time feedback-driven behavior)

Physical AI transforms AI models from static digital systems into autonomous physical agents.

## Difference Between AI and Physical AI

| Traditional AI | Physical AI |
|----------------|-------------|
| Purely digital | Embodied in real-world systems |
| Operates in simulated/virtual environments | Interacts with dynamic physical environments |
| No constraints like gravity, friction | Must obey physical laws & safety constraints |
| Output: predictions, classifications | Output: actions, movement, manipulation |
| Evaluated on accuracy/loss | Evaluated on robustness, stability, autonomy |

Physical AI introduces **physics**, **mechanics**, and **real-world uncertainty**, making it far more complex.

## Why Physical AI Matters
Physical AI is reshaping industries:

- **Healthcare:** surgical robots, rehabilitation exoskeletons  
- **Manufacturing:** industrial robots, autonomous assembly  
- **Transportation:** autonomous vehicles and UAVs  
- **Defense:** autonomous drones and ground systems  
- **Agriculture:** precision farming robots  
- **Personal use:** service robots, home assistants  

It enables solutions to real-world problems that digital AI alone cannot solve.
