Robotic Agents
Overview

Robotic agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous systems that perceive, reason, and act in the world. They combine sensors, actuators, and decision-making algorithms.

Types of Robotic Agents

Mobile robots: ground, aerial, underwater

Manipulators: robotic arms for industrial or service tasks

Humanoids: mimic human morphology and behavior

Hybrid agents: combination of mobility and manipulation

Agent Architectures

Reactive: stimulus-response behavior

Deliberative: planning and reasoning

Hybrid: combines reactive and deliberative approaches

Summary

Robotic agents integrate embodiment and intelligence to perform complex tasks in real-world environments.
