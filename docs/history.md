# History of Embodied Intelligence 
## Overview
The field of Physical AI has roots in engineering, biology, cybernetics, and early robotics. This chapter traces the development of embodied intelligence from mechanical automata to modern autonomous robotic systems.

## Early Robotics
- **Ancient automata** (Heron of Alexandria, 1st century CE)
- **Mechanical clockwork robots** during the Renaissance
- **Industrial robotics origins** in the 1950s
- First industrial robot arm: **UNIMATE (1961)**

These systems were mechanically advanced but lacked intelligence.

## Evolution of AI in Physical Systems
Three major waves shaped Physical AI:

### **1. Cybernetics (1940s–1960s)**
- Norbert Wiener’s cybernetics
- Feedback control systems
- Early autonomous machines (e.g., Grey Walter's tortoises)

### **2. Robotics + Symbolic AI (1970s–1990s)**
- Shakey the Robot (first logic-driven robot)
- Structured, rule-based intelligence
- No robust perception → limited autonomy

### **3. Embodied & Learning-Based Robotics (2000s–Present)**
- Machine learning and deep learning integrated into robots
- Computer vision breakthroughs
- Real-time sensor fusion
- Simulation-based training (MuJoCo, Isaac Gym)

These advances produced modern autonomous systems: drones, self-driving cars, humanoids.

## Key Milestones
- **1997:** First autonomous mobile robots in warehouses  
- **2010:** Early autonomous driving prototypes  
- **2015:** Boston Dynamics’ dynamic locomotion  
- **2020:** Embodied reinforcement learning at scale  
- **2023+:** Humanoid robots enter commercial markets

## Summary
The journey from early mechanisms to intelligent embodied agents reflects advances in AI, sensors, actuators, and computing. Physical AI is the culmination of decades of interdisciplinary progress.
