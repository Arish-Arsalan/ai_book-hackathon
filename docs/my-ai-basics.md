# Machine Learning Models

# Overview
ML models are at the core of Physical AI for perception, prediction, and control.

Model Types

Supervised learning: classification, regression

Unsupervised learning: clustering, anomaly detection

Reinforcement learning: trial-and-error optimization

Imitation learning: learning from demonstrations

Integration in Robotics

Vision, motion planning, manipulation, and adaptive behavior

# Summary

ML models empower robots to learn from data, adapt, and generalize across tasks.
