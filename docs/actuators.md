Actuators
Overview

Actuators translate computational commands into physical motion.

Types of Actuators

Electric: DC motors, servo motors, stepper motors

Hydraulic: high power, smooth force control

Pneumatic: lightweight, fast, limited precision

Emerging: soft actuators, artificial muscles, variable stiffness actuators

Control Techniques

Low-level: PID, feedforward

High-level: trajectory planning, inverse kinematics

Summary

Actuators define the robot’s capability to act on its environment. Proper selection and control are crucial.
